Connecting to the Server using a Browser
If the server started successfully, you can connect to it using a web browser. 
If you started the server on the same computer as the browser, open the URL http://localhost:8082. 
If you want to connect to the application from another computer, you need to provide the IP address of the server, for example: http://192.168.0.2:8082. 
If you enabled TLS on the server side, the URL needs to start with https://.



Login
At the login page, you need to provide connection information to connect to a database. 
Set the JDBC driver class of your database, the JDBC URL, user name, and password. If you are done, click [Connect].
You can save and reuse previously saved settings. The settings are stored in a properties file (see Settings of the H2 Console).
